        "**Detrended Fluctuation Analysis** is used to compare fluctuations of a signal across different time scales. The log of the (sum of the?) fluctuations are plotted on the Y axis against the log of the time scale length (X axis). If the relation is linear, there's a power law relation between the signal and the time. That is, there are a few signals with significantly high values (e.g. amplitude) and then there's many signals with a low value — hence, the power law. \n",
